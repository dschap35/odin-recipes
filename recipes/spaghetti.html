        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F</li>
            <li>Whisk together the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic, and water.
                Add the meat, cheese, and breadcrumbs and mix until combined. Be careful not to mix
                too much, just enough for the ingredients to all be together.
            </li>
            <li>Roll the mix into meatballs about the size of a golf ball. Place meatballs on an
                ungreased baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, then remove the sheet and turn the
                meatballs. Place the sheet in the oven for 10 more minutes until nicely brown.
            </li>
            <li>Simmer the Marinara sauce in a large skillet. Place the meatballs to simmer in the 
                Marinara sauce for about 10 minutes and cover with lid.
            </li>
            <li>While the meatballs are finishing boil a large pot of water. Add the spaghetti and 
                cook until softened but still firm. Drain the pasta and add the spaghetti to the sauce.

            </li>
            <li>Serve topped with fresh basil and more grated cheese</li>
        </ol>
