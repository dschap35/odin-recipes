# odin-recipes
This project will demonstrate the skills to create a web homepage and links to other
webpages on the website. It will contain links to pages that will contain a title of 
a dish followed by the image of the dish. Under the Image of the dish will be a list that contains
all of the ingredients of the dish in order. To practice the website will contain about 3 recipes
for now.
